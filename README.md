<h2>A Simple CSS/JS Component to build Dynamic Grids</h2>

This component was built during my studies of FrontEnd Web Development.
It's main objective is to be used as an easy and quick container in which dynamic grid cells can be placed simply by adding the correct classes to HTML elements.

The motivation to build this component, beyond the experimentation involved in FrontEnd studies, was to standardize a type of form in my current work environment characterized by its different input fields and its general common structure.

Beyond the main component, there is also the stylesheets "evo-standard-form" and "evo-standard-tablegrid" which roughly mimics my work environment, used to test and demonstrate how it works.

Hopefully this will be a evolving component, maintaining the main objective. Any constructive suggestions, critiques, tips and lessons will be most welcome and appreciated.
